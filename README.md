# DIVA-Directional-Influence-for-Interpretable-Video-Anomaly-Detection
DIVA (Directional Influence for Video Anomaly Detection) is a gradient-free TCAV adaptation for black-box VAD models (e.g., KNN, clustering, KDE). It perturbs CLIP embeddings along concept directions to reveal how interpretable concepts influence anomaly scoresâ€”no model access needed.
